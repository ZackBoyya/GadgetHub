          <p>
            If you are on the train or sitting in a cafe sipping a cup of
            coffee, try looking at people’s phones around you, you’ll be bound
            to see one that’s pretty beaten up or has a cracked screen, and
            these poor souls probably just don’t want to pay for a new phone
            because they are so expensive these days and just can’t afford to
            break another one. This is the very reason why aside from gimmicky
            AI features, many brands have begun to emphasize durability on their
            smartphones, with companies like Honor leading the pack with its X
            series phones, although the recent Honor X9c still isn’t affordable
            to many people, such as students or someone that’s just getting
            started in the workforce.

            One of the annoying things about most open earbuds is that they can
            easily fall out of your ear and don’t deliver great audio quality as
            in-ear earbuds, but in-ears can cause discomfort the longer you wear
            them, which is why I recently turn to the soundcore AeroFit, an
            open-fit earbuds that I have been wearing for months now, it has
            become a staple whenever I need to indulge myself in some tunes
            while not needing people to shout at me in the office.

            One of the reasons why people keep looking forward to a new iPhone
            every year is because of the ‘magical’ things that Apple announce on
            stage, but this time, I think Samsung finally has the better magic.
            Let’s face it, the past two Samsung Ultra flagships do feel a little
            settled, aside from camera and performance improvements and having
            the S Pen from the Note series, they look the same and the upgrades
            don’t justify for many to upgrade from the S21 Ultra. The Galaxy S24
            Ultra may look the same as before, but it’s a whole new breed that
            comes with many exciting improvements a modern flagship really
            needs.
